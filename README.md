## [Component One - All the news 2.0](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset)

### Overview

This dataset contains 2,688,878 news articles and essays from 27 American publications, spanning January 1, 2016 to April 2, 2020. It is an expanded edition of the original All the News dataset on Kaggle, which was compiled in early 2017. While the original dataset contains more than 100,000 articles, the new dataset's greater size and breadth should allow researchers to study a wider selection of media.

The dataset in the link is offered only as a compressed csv file. Got many trouble downloading it so, decided to put it available with a bit of granularization.
